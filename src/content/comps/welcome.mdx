primaryDescription:
  - Radial Architecture is a system architecture model for organizations building large, multi-domain platforms in an era of AI, composable systems, and continuous change.
  - It focuses on how large systems converge around a governing center, how work flows through contracts instead of ad-hoc integrations, and how AI can participate in those flows without breaking reliability, ownership, or trust.
  - This site explores those ideas through the lens of composable commerce, not as a vertical, but as a demanding, real-world proving ground for modern system architecture.
