# radialarchitecture.com

This repository contains the source for **radialarchitecture.com**, the canonical home of the *Radial Architecture* essay and all subsequent writing derived from or expanding upon it.

The site prioritizes **clarity, durability, and architectural restraint** over features, growth mechanics, or platform concerns.

## What This Repo Is

* A **static Astro site**, installed at the repository root
* A **publishing surface**, not a product or application
* The long-term **canon** for Radial Architecture writing
* A concrete demonstration of the architectural principles it describes

The site is intentionally simple, legible, and slow to change.

---

## What This Repo Is Not

* ❌ A monorepo
* ❌ A framework playground
* ❌ A marketing site
* ❌ A blog feed or content platform
* ❌ A place for speculative features

If a change does not increase clarity, legibility, or trust, it does not belong here.

## Canonical Publishing Strategy

* The original *Radial Architecture* essay exists on Medium and **remains canonical**.
* The version hosted here may include revisions or expansions, but does not supersede Medium for that essay.
* **All new Radial Architecture–related writing is published here first**, then cross-posted elsewhere with a canonical link pointing back to this site.

This repository is the source of truth for future work.

## Architectural Intent

This site is deliberately designed to **model Radial Architecture**:

* A stable **hub** (the canon)
* Bounded **spokes** (essays, navigation, chat)
* Explicit governance
* Minimal coupling
* No hidden coordination

Tooling is incidental. Structure is intentional.

## Scope Discipline

Detailed scope, layout, and styling constraints are defined in project documentation and should be treated as authoritative.

This repository is an **island**.
Complexity is introduced only when it is earned.
